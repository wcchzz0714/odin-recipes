    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <p>Buffalo wings made simple in an Instant Pot® and without the fry. The Instant Pot® cooks these to perfection. They hold together for easy handling but as soon as you sink your teeth into them, they are fall-off-the-bone tender. Serve with carrot sticks, celery, and ranch if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (5 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup and 2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 and ¼ pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>⅓ cup and 2 tablespoons and ½ teaspoon buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>1 and ¼ teaspoons dry ranch dressing mix</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Set trivet inside and place wings on top. Secure the lid, seal, and select Manual setting. Cook on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix wing sauce and ranch dressing mix in a large bowl. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully. Transfer wings to the bowl of sauce using tongs. Toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a wire baking rack over the foil-lined baking sheet and arrange wings on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high. Broil wings for 5 minutes. Flip wings and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes more. Toss with any remaining sauce if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
